# Agentum90 — The 90‑Day AI Engineering Mastery Challenge

Agentum90 is a **self-paced, high-intensity, portfolio-focused AI Engineering challenge** designed to build industry-grade depth in Machine Learning, GenAI, MLOps, and Systems Engineering. Inspired by top-tier engineering roadmaps and technical discipline, Agentum90 turns 90 days into a **career-defining transformation engine**.

This repository serves as:

- A **public portfolio artifact** showing your commitment, rigor, and mastery.
- A **technical tracker** of the 90 daily tasks and 9 weekly capstones.
- A **reference hub** linking learners to the daily task and weekly project content delivered via website/email.
- A **personal accelerator** to reach FAANG/DeepMind/AI Labs–ready skill level.

## 🚀 Vision

Agentum90 is built on a simple belief:  
**Talent is common. Discipline is rare. Transformation is engineered.**

Every task, project, and checkpoint is designed with:

- **Technical Depth** → ML, GenAI, LangChain, Retrieval, Model Internals, DL.
- **Engineering Rigor** → APIs, MLOps, Docker, CI/CD, vector stores.
- **Systems Thinking** → scaling, architecture, design principles.
- **Research Alignment** → papers, algorithms, reproducibility.

> This is not a tutorial series — it is a **professional-grade engineering gauntlet**.

---

## 📌 Structure

Agentum90 is divided into three key layers:

### 1. Daily Tasks (90 Total)

Delivered via **website/email**, each day includes:

- One technical concept  
- One implementation task  
- One short reflection/log  

Learners are encouraged to optionally **log progress in this GitHub repo** for portfolio tracking.

### 2. Weekly Capstone Projects (9 Projects)

Every ~10 days, learners receive a **portfolio-grade project**:

- **Intermediate → Advanced**  
- **Showcase-ready** for GitHub & résumé  
- Mapped to **FAANG SWE + AI Engineer expectations**  

Learners may **fork the GitHub templates** and upload their completed work.

### 3. Mastery Checkpoints

Placed at Day 30, 60, and 90:

- Evaluate knowledge, implementation depth, and architectural understanding  
- Serve as **portfolio-grade milestones**

## 🧠 What You Will Build

Over 90 days, participants will produce a **portfolio-ready body of work**:

- **90 Daily Logs** – technical exercises documenting experiments and insights  
- **9 Weekly Projects** – intermediate-to-advanced builds demonstrating real-world AI engineering skills  
- **GenAI & LLM Systems** – retrieval pipelines, embeddings, multi-agent orchestration  
- **Scalable AI Services** – deployable APIs and microservices  
- **1 Mastery Capstone** – a polished, end-to-end AI application combining all learned skills  

> Every artifact is designed to be **resume-ready, GitHub-ready, and LinkedIn-ready**.
