# Agentum90 — The 90‑Day AI Engineering Mastery Challenge

Agentum90 is a **self-paced, high-intensity, portfolio-focused AI Engineering challenge** designed to build *industry-grade depth* in Machine Learning, GenAI, MLOps, and Systems Engineering. Inspired by top-tier engineering roadmaps and high standard execution discipline, Agentum90 turns 90 days into a **career-defining transformation engine**.

This repository serves as:

* A **public portfolio artifact** showing your commitment, rigor, and mastery.
* A **technical tracker** of all 90 daily tasks and 9 weekly capstones.
* A **personal accelerator** to reach FAANG/DeepMind/AI Labs–ready skill level.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Agentum90 is built on a simple belief:
**Talent is common. Discipline is rare. Transformation is engineered.**

Every task, project, and checkpoint is designed with:

* **Technical Depth** → ML, GenAI, LangChain, Retrieval, Model Internals, DL.
* **Engineering Rigor** → APIs, MLOps, Docker, CI/CD, vector stores.
* **Systems Thinking** → scaling, architecture, design principles.
* **Research Alignment** → papers, algorithms, reproducibility.

This is not a tutorial series.
This is a **professional-grade engineering gauntlet**.

---

## 📌 Structure

Agentum90 is divided into:

### **1. Daily Tasks (90 Total)**

Each day includes:

* One technical concept
* One implementation task
* One short reflection/log

### **2. Weekly Capstone Projects (12 Projects)**

Every week ends with a project that is:

* **Intermediate → Advanced** level
* **Showcase-ready** for GitHub & résumé
* Mapped to **FAANG SWE + AI Engineer expectations**

### **3. Mastery Checkpoints**

Placed at Day 30, 60, and 90.
These evaluate:

* Knowledge
* Implementation depth
* Architectural understanding

🧠 What You Will Build

Over 90 days, participants will produce a portfolio-ready body of work:

90 Daily Logs – short, focused technical exercises documenting experiments and insights

9 Weekly Projects – intermediate-to-advanced builds demonstrating real-world AI engineering skills

GenAI & LLM Systems – retrieval pipelines, embeddings, multi-agent orchestration

Scalable AI Services – deployable APIs and microservices

1 Mastery Capstone – a polished, end-to-end AI application combining all learned skills

Showcased across:

* GitHub
* Résumé
* LinkedIn
* Possibly your website

## 🏆 Hidden Rewards

Agentum90 includes unlockable rewards that appear **after specific milestones**:

* **Tiered Certificates** (Bronze → Platinum → Chaos Tier)
* **AetherLang Engineering Badge**
* **Mastery MetaID** for résumé verification
* **Secret Challenge #91** (Unlocked only upon completion)

Nothing here spoils those surprises.

## ✨ Guiding Principles

**1. Quality > Quantity**
Only deep, high-impact tasks.

**2. Engineering > Coursework**
Everything leads to building real systems.

**3. Visibility = Opportunity**
This repo becomes one of the strongest proofs of skill.

**4. Consistency Wins**
Daily logs matter.

---

## 🧩 How to Use This Repo

* Upload your daily progress.
* Upload weekly project summaries.
* Maintain clean commit messages.
* Treat this like a professional engineering log.

---

## 🌐 Why Agentum90 Matters

In an era of AI commoditization, **clarity of execution** and **technical depth** differentiate engineers. Agentum90 gives you both.

When someone sees this repo, they should immediately understand:

* You are serious.
* You are consistent.
* You can build.
* You can think like an engineer.

This is Ivy-tier positioning.
